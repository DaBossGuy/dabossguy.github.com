<h1 class="finklecenter">So that was a lie.......</h1>
<h2 class="finklecenter">By Sebatian Ray</h2>
<p class="finklep">So uhm, that March 1st deadline was uhh, not so true. I have been doing some testing and I'd like to project a 100% complete deadline at around the start of next year. Of course things could change but for now thats the deadline. I'm also working on ALOT of other stuff too (not my 25+ missing assignments though). And obvioulsy I'm also working on the Finkleheimer Files. But uh yeah. Seeya.</p>
